    "input": "",
    "output": "This is a gradient from dark (⠀, intensity 0) to bright (⣿, intensity 255). Each braille character encodes a pixel value, with more dots meaning brighter pixels. This represents a smooth left-to-right brightness transition."

    "input": "",
    "output": "This pattern shows bright (⣿) regions on the left and right with a dark (⠀) gap in the middle. This could represent two bright objects separated by darkness, like two lights in a dark room or a split image."
